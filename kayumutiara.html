                <p>
                    My role as the Logistics Head is to lead my team in creating posters that compete with the other teams and sections. I direct and supervise any progress made by my team, and guide them in any difficulties that we encounter along the way. We are also tasked in designing the layout of the overall Dulaang KayuMutiara playbill, where I direct the layout that we are gonna follow for consistency and branding.<br><br>

                    As a Core Documentation Manager, I handle the documentation group for all the sections. I instruct and coordinate with them for what shots to take, where they will take position on the venue, and how the videos are gonna be shot for consistency. I am also in charge of recording the entire play using a still camera. I am also in charge of taking photoshoots of the marketing teams, and the core committee that made this event possible.

            <h2>This experience has given me a number of valuable insights, and has nurtured me to become a competent leader and a hard worker. It tested my limits and my capabilities as a leader, and I believe that I was able to manage my team well. We were able to create quality outputs, follow deadlines, and remained organized throughout the two-month period of preparation. There were times that we had a hard time and lacked communication with each other, but we were able to resolve them together as a group. I am glad that my team was reliable and accomplished tasks that I assigned for them, and overcame the pressure and stress that this event has given us.<br><br>
            
            
            In summary, this whole event has been a valuable learning experience for me. It trained me on event organization, planning, and team management. Through this experience, I was able to assess myself both as a worker and leader. I was able to empathize with my team, and together, we were able to do our best in providing the best quality outputs for the event production.</h2><br><br>
